/* EXERCISE 1
Write the code to execute a SUM between the number 12 and 20.

 /* EXERCISE 2
 Create a variable named x containing the number 12. Then, UNCOMMENT the "return x" line.

 /* EXERCISE 3
 Create a variable named name containing the string John Doe Then, UNCOMMENT the "return name" line.

 /* EXERCISE 4
 Execute a SUBTRACTION between the number 12 and the variable x, which stores the value 12.
 Then, UNCOMMENT the commented out lines.

 /* EXERCISE 5
 Create two variables: name1 and name2. name1 is equal to john, name2 is equal to John.
 Create a boolean variable "result1" that is true when name1 is equal to name2
 Create a boolean variable "result2", that is true when name1 lowercased and name2 lowercased are equal (without changing the value of name2).
 
 Eventually, return both result1 and result2, i.e. UNCOMMENT the commented out lines.

 Write the code to print the literal value of a number x: its value must be less than 10. (ex.: if x is 1 print "one", if 5 print "five" etc.).
